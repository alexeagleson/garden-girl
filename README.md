Garden Girl is a 2-5 player multiplayer "Bomberman Clone" written as a replacement project for the cancelled PTBO Game Jam 05. Completed in 7 days from Saturday March 14th to Saturday March 21st.

To play the game:

1. Open the "Display Screen" on your computer. The display screen is only for watching the game, not playing.

2. Open the "Controller" on your phone (or another tab, but it's better on mobile)

3. Press the "A" button on your controller screen to mark yourself ready. You need at least 2 players to start a game.
